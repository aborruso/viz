# Data in the United States

## Visualization from the New York Times data repository 

The New York Times is releasing a series of data files with cumulative counts of coronavirus cases in the United States, at the state and county level, over time 

> We have used this data to power our [maps](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) and [reporting](https://www.nytimes.com/coronavirus) tracking the outbreak, and it is now being made available to the public in response to requests from researchers, scientists and government officials who would like access to the data to better understand the outbreak
