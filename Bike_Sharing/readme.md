### Real time station status 

Example of a status map created with iXMaps for two bike sharing sites. BlueBikes  at Boston and CitiBike at New York City. Both publish the actual bike sharing station status in the GBFS format.

Every map is realized in two different ways, first as dedicated application, second as iXmaps project loaded into the iXMaps project explorer:

They are based on **trip history data** released by [BLUEbikes](https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data) and [Transport For London](https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/).
