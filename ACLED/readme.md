In seguito la descrizione del progetto ACLED preso dal sito <a href="https://www.acleddata.com/" terget="_blank">www.acleddata.com</a>:

* "The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) is a disaggregated conflict collection, analysis and crisis mapping project. ACLED collects the dates, actors, types of violence, locations, and fatalities of all reported political violence and protest events across Africa, South Asia, South East Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Latin America. Political violence and protest includes events that occur within civil wars and periods of instability, public protest and regime breakdown. ACLED’s aim is to capture the forms, actors, dates and locations of political violence and protest as it occurs across states. The ACLED team conducts analysis to describe, explore and test conflict scenarios, and makes both data and analysis open to freely use by the public."

* "Non-Commercial Licenses - ACLED’s full dataset is available for use free of charge by non-commercial entities and organizations (e.g., non-profit organizations, government agencies, academic institutions) using the data for non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms of Use. Non-commercial licenses may also be granted to for-profit media outlets or journalists citing ACLED’s content in works of journalism; provided that such works are made available to the general public and benefit public discourse on the topic, subject to ACLED’s prior, written approval."

## Ci sono due mappe per visualizzare gli eventi del ACLED del 2019:


[ACLED 2019 Incidents by Event Type](http://explore.ixmaps.com?project=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gjrichter/viz/master/ACLED/ixmaps_project_ACLED_API_Incidents_2019_by_event_type.json)

[ACLED 2019 Incidents by Actor](http://explore.ixmaps.com?project=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gjrichter/viz/master/ACLED/ixmaps_project_ACLED_API_Incidents_2019_by_actor.json)


Le mappa caricano i dati attraverso l'API di ACLED; la mappa che colora gli ecventi per 'Actor' è un pò impegnativa da caricare;
si chiede un po' di pazienza.

Una volta caricata, si possono applicare filtri cliccando sui colori o attraverso lo strumento apposito nella barra in alto a destra.
